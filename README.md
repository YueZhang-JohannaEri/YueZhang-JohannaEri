### Hi, I’m **Erica Zhang** 👋 
I hold a Master's degree in Business Analytics from Northeastern University (Boston, MA), and a Bachelor's degree in Finance and Banking from the University of Missouri (Columbia, MO). Since 2022, I have been working as a Project Analyst on policy-oriented projects at the Municipal Development and Reform Commission.

### About me:
I’m deeply interested in how technology actually lands in real life: how it changes the way we think, make decisions, and express creativity. To me, AI should never shrink our thinking into predefined patterns. It should free us to think more boldly,explore more openly, and create with more confidence. That belief is why I continue exploring Human–AI research after work: to push for an AI future that strengthens human thinking instead of numbing it.

### My interests:
- The intersection of Human–AI Decision-Making, Business Analytics, and Explainable Machine Learning
  
### What I Work On: 
- **Machine Learning & Causal Analysis** for real-world business and user behavior insights  
- **Knowledge Graph + LLM + Reasoning** for transparent reasoning and mechanism understanding  
- **Human–AI Decision Modeling** focusing on how AI supports data-driven decision-making
